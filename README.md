# APG - Anti Prop Griefing & Crash Protection

![- APG - Light Weight, Easy to Use, Stops Crashes](https://i.imgur.com/DrbZOgk.png "APG - Light Weight, Easy to Use, Stops Crashes")

We are dedicated and focused on providing servers with the best answer to prop
griefers, killers, and exploiters. We saw all the currently available addons and
felt that neither one of them alone could really do everything that we wanted it
to do, so naturally we made our own and decided to share it with you.

## This does still require a prop protection addon

### Compatible prop protection addons (with CPPI)

* [Falco's Prop Protection (FPP)](https://github.com/FPtje/Falcos-Prop-protection/)
* [PatchProtect](https://github.com/Patcher56/PatchProtect)
* [Simple Prop Protection (SPP)](https://github.com/Donkie/SimplePropProtection)

### ⚠ Don't use more then one prop protection/anti prop griefing addon at a time!

### ( You have been warned! )

* ⚠ Detours [PhysgunPickup](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/PhysgunPickup) for better confirmations
* ⚠ Detours [SetColor](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Entity/SetColor) to prevent stuff from turning purple/pink unexpectedly
* ⚠ Detours [SetCollisionGroup](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Entity/SetCollisionGroup) to prevent overrides
* ⚠ Detours Advanced Dupe functions which might cause compatability issues. This is to prevent a few issues.

Lag triggers are based on fancy algorithms and timers, if you are getting false positives try messing around with the values.

If you find any issue, exploit, possible improvement, suggestions, feel free to make an issue!
